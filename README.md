# Introduction

This is very fresh (Oct 27, 2015).

More info coming soon as I'm developing this for our internal use.

# Development

Install all dependencies:

```
$ npm i
```

You can also use a globally installed
[nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) to automatically
restart the server whenever the server source code changes.

```
nodemon
```
